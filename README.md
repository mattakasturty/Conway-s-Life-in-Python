John Conway's famous cellular automation game "Life"

The rules of Life are very simple. 
You start with a rectangular array of cells. 
Each cell is either “alive” (black) or “dead” (white). Initially, all cells are dead.

Every cell has eight neighbors. To make a new generation, apply these rules to each cell:

(a) If the cell is alive and has fewer than two or more than three living neighbors, the cell dies (from loneliness or overcrowding, respectively).

(b) If the cell is dead and has exactly three living neighbors, the cell revives.
